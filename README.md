- 👋 Hi, I’m Legend Artis. I've graduated from Arizona State University in December 2019, and earned a Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics with an emphasis on software programming.

- 👀 I’m interested in anything related to mathematics and computers. I've been learning computer architecture as a teen, building computers for friends and family for fun!

- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ and cryptography. Cryptography is a combination of mathematics, computer science, and data security, all of which sound fun and exciting for me.

- 💞️ I’m looking forward to collaborate on new, basic cryptography projects to help strengthen my fundamental understanding of the subject in theory and in practice. My goal is to be as resourceful in the subject matter as possible to help advance companies' security and analysis.

- 📫 You can reach me via LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/legend-artis/) or my email (legendartis@gmail.com).

Thank you for reading my humble page :)
